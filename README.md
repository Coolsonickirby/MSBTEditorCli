<h1>MSBTEditorCli</h1>
<hr>
<p>Credits all due to <a href="https://github.com/IcySon55/">IcySon55</a> and <a href="https://github.com/exelix11/">exelix11</a> for the original MSBT source code, all I did was rework it to make it export MSBTs as JSON and vice-versa because there was nothing I could find that does that.</p>
<h4>Usage:</h4>
```MSBTEditorCli.exe [INPUT FILE] [OUTPUT FILE]```
